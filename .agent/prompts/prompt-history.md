# Prompt History

## Prompt 1 — Establish Agentic Development Workflow

### User instruction
Before making any application changes, establish a persistent agentic development workflow for this repository. Do not modify the existing application source code yet. First inspect the repository structure and understand what kind of project this is. Then create the documentation structure at the repository root (.agent/context.md, .agent/status.md, .agent/skills/*, .agent/prompts/*). Follow strict rules: no application code changes, no new dependencies, no redesign, no NestJS/Prisma/PostgreSQL code yet, no fabrication, no logging secrets, keep .agent separate from runtime code. Inspect generated files, show concise summary, explain findings, and wait for next instruction.

### Agent interpretation
Establish a persistent agentic workflow system inside a dedicated `.agent/` directory at the repository root. First analyze the existing repository (monorepo structure, MERN stack, dependencies, scripts, git state) without touching runtime application code or installing packages. Create comprehensive, factual documentation files (`context.md`, `status.md`, 8 skill guides, `prompt-history.md`, `decisions.md`) ensuring all details are accurate, factual, and strictly free of secrets. Verify generated files, summarize findings, and await further instructions without implementing application features.

### Action taken
1. Inspected repository root, `backend/`, and `frontend/` directory structures and manifests.
2. Verified Git remotes, commit log, and confirmed the `baseline-original` git tag.
3. Created `.agent/context.md` detailing project goal, architecture, tech stack, constraints, and deployment targets.
4. Created `.agent/status.md` summarizing current phase, completed tasks, pending decisions, known issues, and verification status.
5. Created eight skill files in `.agent/skills/` (`repository-analysis.md`, `architecture.md`, `frontend-development.md`, `backend-development.md`, `database.md`, `testing.md`, `code-review.md`, `deployment.md`) with standardized sections.
6. Created `.agent/prompts/decisions.md` documenting initial architectural baseline.
7. Created `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md` recording Prompt 1.
8. Inspected all created documentation files.

### Files changed

### Verification
- Executed `git remote -v`, `git log --oneline -10`, and `git tag -l` to verify version control state and baseline tag.
- Executed `node -v` (v24.21.0) and `npm -v` (9.8.0) to confirm local environment runtimes.
- Inspected existing source files (`server.js`, `taskRoutes.js`, `Task.js`, `App.jsx`, `api.js`, `AddTask.jsx`, `TaskList.jsx`, `package.json`).
- Verified directory listing of `.agent/` and its subdirectories to confirm all 12 requested files are created and properly structured.
- Verified that no application source code in `backend/` or `frontend/` was modified.

### Result
All 12 documentation files successfully created under `.agent/` with zero modifications to application source code or package dependencies.

### Next step
Await user instructions regarding next phase, such as architecture decisions, refactoring, or feature development.

## Prompt 2 — Baseline Analysis of Existing Application

### User instruction
Now perform a complete baseline analysis of the existing application. Do not modify any application source code. Do not install dependencies. Do not refactor anything. Do not implement any new feature. Read the existing frontend, backend and README carefully. Analyze the application across 8 areas: repository structure, frontend, backend, database, API contract, current functionality, deployment, and technical risks when migrating to NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL. Update .agent/context.md with baseline architecture and target architecture, update .agent/status.md indicating baseline analysis is complete, update .agent/skills/repository-analysis.md with project-specific findings and lessons learned, update .agent/prompts/prompt-history.md with Prompt 2. Record in .agent/prompts/decisions.md only if an actual architectural decision was made (do not create one merely for the sake of creating one). Verify zero source modifications and no dependency installations, provide a concise report, and wait for next instruction.

### Agent interpretation
Execute an exhaustive, read-only architectural analysis of the current MERN codebase, tracing repository structure, components, state management, HTTP requests, API routes, database models, CRUD flows, deployment configurations, and migration risks toward the target stack (NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL). Update agent documentation (`context.md`, `status.md`, `repository-analysis.md`, `prompt-history.md`) with factual baseline findings and project-specific lessons learned without creating false decisions or modifying application source files.

### Action taken
1. Conducted an in-depth source inspection of frontend files (`index.html`, `main.jsx`, `App.jsx`, `AddTask.jsx`, `TaskList.jsx`, `api.js`, `index.css`, `App.css`, `vite.config.js`, `eslint.config.js`, `frontend/.gitignore`) and backend files (`server.js`, `taskRoutes.js`, `Task.js`, `package.json`).
2. Cataloged exact API contracts for all 4 task endpoints (`GET /api/tasks`, `POST /api/tasks`, `PUT /api/tasks/:id`, `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`).
3. Documented complete end-to-end user flows from browser interactions to database operations.
4. Analyzed deployment mechanisms described in `README.md` and uncovered documentation drift (hardcoded URL in `frontend/src/api.js` vs. documented `VITE_API_URL`).
5. Identified specific technical risks when migrating to NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL (ID format differences `_id` vs `id`, HTTP status differences, strict schema typing, DTO validation, and port/CORS handling).
6. Updated `.agent/context.md` with factual baseline and target architecture.
7. Updated `.agent/status.md` marking baseline analysis complete and noting pending decisions and known issues.
8. Updated `.agent/skills/repository-analysis.md` with project-specific findings and lessons learned.
9. Appended Prompt 2 record to `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md`.

### Files changed
- `.agent/context.md` (updated)
- `.agent/status.md` (updated)
- `.agent/skills/repository-analysis.md` (updated)
- `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md` (updated)

### Verification
- Ran `git status` to verify that no application source code files were touched and only `.agent/` documentation files were modified.
- Verified that no dependencies were installed (`node_modules` and lockfiles remain untouched).
- Verified internal consistency of documentation across all updated files.

### Result
Baseline analysis complete. Entire system architecture, API contracts, user flows, deployment setup, and migration risks thoroughly documented in `.agent/` with zero application code modifications.

### Next step
Await user instructions for architectural decision-making or migration planning.

## Prompt 3 — Architecture & Implementation Planning for NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL & Kanban Transformation

### User instruction
Transition from repository analysis into architecture planning without modifying application source code, installing dependencies, or implementing changes yet. Inspect reference repository https://github.com/parthlashkari/taskflow (treat only as product/UI reference). Plan transformation from MERN to React + TypeScript frontend, NestJS backend, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL database, and Render deployment. Product direction: TaskFlow-inspired Kanban workflow (To Do, In Progress, Done, priorities, tags, due dates, search/filtering, core CRUD) and Task Insights / Analytics (total, completed, in-progress, overdue, completion percentage, counts by priority). Produce detailed plan covering: existing-to-target mapping, target architecture, database design, API contract, frontend architecture, state management, migration strategy, risk analysis, verification strategy, and agentic workflow prompt sequence. Update only .agent/context.md, .agent/status.md, .agent/skills/architecture.md, .agent/prompts/prompt-history.md, and .agent/prompts/decisions.md. Verify zero application code changes and stop after planning phase.

### Agent interpretation
Formulate an end-to-end, production-ready architectural design and migration blueprint to evolve the current simple MERN task list into a modern, strongly-typed NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL backend and React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 Kanban experience inspired by TaskFlow with an added Task Insights analytics feature. Document the mapping, system architecture, database schema, API contracts, component tree, state management, phased migration, risk mitigations, verification gates, and agent prompt sequences across the `.agent/` documentation suite while ensuring zero modifications to application source files, package manifests, or lockfiles.

### Action taken
1. Fetched and inspected reference repository `parthlashkari/taskflow` to analyze its Kanban UX, priority scheme, tag usage, and modal interactions.
2. Formulated a 1-to-1 existing-to-target mapping across frontend, backend, database, API, configuration, and deployment layers.
3. Designed the target NestJS modular architecture, isolating validation (DTOs/ValidationPipe), business logic (Services), database access (PrismaService), and error representations (global exception filter).
4. Authored the minimal PostgreSQL/Prisma schema with `Task` model, enums (`TaskStatus`, `TaskPriority`), scalar string arrays for tags, due dates, timestamps, and indexes.
5. Defined the target REST API contracts for `/api/tasks` (CRUD, status transitions, query filters, and `/analytics`).
6. Designed the React 19 + TypeScript component hierarchy and local/server state management architecture with optimistic updates.
7. Crafted a 10-phase migration strategy, complete risk matrix with mitigations, verification checkpoints, and a 9-step agentic workflow prompt sequence.
8. Updated `.agent/prompts/decisions.md` with Decision 2.
9. Updated `.agent/skills/architecture.md` with layer responsibilities, data flow diagram, and architectural guidelines.
10. Updated `.agent/context.md` with target architecture, Prisma schema, API table, component tree, and analytics specifications.
11. Updated `.agent/status.md` marking architecture planning complete.
12. Appended Prompt 3 to `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md`.

### Files changed
- `.agent/prompts/decisions.md` (updated)
- `.agent/skills/architecture.md` (updated)
- `.agent/context.md` (updated)
- `.agent/status.md` (updated)
- `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md` (updated)

### Verification
- Executed `git status` and `git diff` to confirm zero application source files, package manifests, or lockfiles were modified.
- Verified that no dependencies were installed.
- Verified internal consistency across all `.agent/` documentation.

### Result
Architecture planning and migration blueprint successfully completed and documented in `.agent/`. Application source code remains completely pristine.

### Next step
Await user instruction to proceed with Phase 1 implementation (Backend foundation & NestJS setup).

## Prompt 4 — Phase 1 Backend Migration: Replace Express with NestJS Foundation

### User instruction
Begin implementation of the backend migration. Replace the existing Express backend with a NestJS TypeScript backend foundation for this phase ONLY (do NOT introduce Prisma or PostgreSQL yet; do NOT modify the frontend; do NOT implement TaskFlow UI, analytics, authentication, or unrelated features). Create a clean NestJS modular structure (main.ts, AppModule, TasksModule, TasksController, TasksService) preserving the `/api/tasks` REST resource concept. Configure global prefix, CORS, scripts, tsconfig, and avoid fake persistence logic or dead Express server code. Before implementing: inspect backend, identify endpoints/functionality to preserve, explain plan briefly, and implement only this phase. Verify build, startup, `/api` boundary, and that frontend and Prisma/Postgres are untouched. Update .agent documentation (status.md, context.md, backend-development.md, prompt-history.md, decisions.md). Do NOT commit changes. Report the required 8 items and stop.

### Agent interpretation
Execute Phase 1 of the backend migration by migrating `backend/` from Express/JavaScript/Mongoose to a NestJS/TypeScript architecture. Remove obsolete Express files, introduce `main.ts`, `AppModule`, `TasksModule`, `TasksController`, and `TasksService`, configure global prefix `/api` and CORS, update `package.json` and TypeScript configuration, run dependencies installation, verify compilation and runtime startup over HTTP, and preserve existing `/api/tasks` resource contracts with explicit `501 NotImplemented` persistence deferral for mutations. Update all requested `.agent/` documentation without committing git changes.

### Action taken
1. Inspected existing Express routes and endpoints (`GET /api/tasks`, `POST /api/tasks`, `PUT /api/tasks/:id`, `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`).
2. Created `backend/.gitignore` to ignore `node_modules/`, `dist/`, and `.env`.
3. Created `backend/tsconfig.json`, `backend/tsconfig.build.json`, and `backend/nest-cli.json`.
4. Created `backend/src/main.ts` with global prefix `api`, CORS configuration, and dynamic port binding.
5. Created `backend/src/app.module.ts`, `backend/src/tasks/tasks.module.ts`, `backend/src/tasks/tasks.controller.ts`, and `backend/src/tasks/tasks.service.ts`.
6. Deleted obsolete Express artifacts: `backend/server.js`, `backend/routes/taskRoutes.js`, and `backend/models/Task.js`.
7. Updated `backend/package.json` with NestJS core dependencies, TypeScript, Nest CLI, and standard scripts (`build`, `start`, `start:dev`, `start:prod`).
8. Installed required dependencies via `npm install`.
9. Compiled TypeScript via `npm run build` and verified bundle in `backend/dist`.
10. Started the NestJS server on port 5000 and verified HTTP responses:
    - `GET http://localhost:5000/api/tasks` returned `HTTP 200 OK` with `[]`.
    - `POST http://localhost:5000/api/tasks` returned `HTTP 501 NotImplemented` (`"Database persistence is scheduled for Phase 2 (Prisma + PostgreSQL migration)."`).
11. Verified zero modifications to `frontend/`.
12. Verified that Prisma and PostgreSQL were not introduced.
13. Updated `.agent/context.md`, `.agent/status.md`, `.agent/skills/backend-development.md`, `.agent/prompts/decisions.md`, and `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md`.

- NestJS Server Startup: Successfully started process and logged mapped routes:
  - `{/api/tasks, GET}`
  - `{/api/tasks, POST}`
  - `{/api/tasks/:id, PUT}`
  - `{/api/tasks/:id, DELETE}`
- Endpoint Verification:
  - `curl -i http://localhost:5000/api/tasks` -> `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, `[]`.
  - `Invoke-WebRequest -Method Post http://localhost:5000/api/tasks` -> `HTTP 501 NotImplemented`.
- Frontend Verification: `git status --short frontend` confirms 0 files modified.
- Scope Verification: No Prisma or PostgreSQL packages installed or referenced in codebase.

### Result
NestJS TypeScript foundation successfully established and verified on port 5000 under the `/api` prefix. Obsolete Express code removed. Working tree is clean except for the staged backend modernization and agent documentation.

### Next step
Proceed to Phase 2: Database Schema & Prisma ORM Integration (provision PostgreSQL, write `prisma/schema.prisma`, run initial migration, and create `PrismaService`).

## Prompt 5 — Phase 2 Database Migration: Prisma 7 and PostgreSQL Integration

### User instruction
Proceed with the Prisma + PostgreSQL migration, using Prisma 7.x specifically (use Prisma 7, NOT Prisma 8; pin CLI and Client to a stable Prisma 7 version; follow Prisma 7 conventions; do not introduce experimental features; do not upgrade to Prisma 8). Requirements: PostgreSQL database, Prisma 7.x, UUID id as Task primary key, title, completed, createdAt, updatedAt, PrismaService as database access layer, TasksService contains business logic, TasksController remains thin, keep GET/POST/PUT/DELETE on /api/tasks, DATABASE_URL from environment configuration, never commit real credentials, create/update .env.example, generate Prisma Client, create initial migration, do not track node_modules, run and verify build and database commands. Update .agent/status.md, .agent/context.md, and .agent/prompts/decisions.md. Do NOT start frontend migration.

### Agent interpretation
Integrate PostgreSQL persistence into the NestJS backend using stable Prisma 7 (`7.10.0`) pinned strictly to prevent auto-upgrades to Prisma 8. Adhere to Prisma 7 conventions (`prisma.config.ts` for migrations and datasource URL, and `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter for runtime `PrismaClient` initialization). Model the `Task` entity with UUID `id`, `title`, `completed`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`. Generate the initial migration (`20261002161001_init`) applying changes to PostgreSQL. Build `PrismaService` extending `PrismaClient` with `PrismaPg` adapter, connect `TasksService` for live database queries, and verify the entire CRUD lifecycle over live HTTP endpoints. Update agent documentation and preserve frontend isolation.

### Action taken
1. Verified available Prisma 7 versions and pinned `@prisma/client: 7.10.0`, `prisma: 7.10.0`, and `@prisma/adapter-pg: 7.10.0` in `backend/package.json`.
2. Created `backend/prisma.config.ts` following Prisma 7 conventions for migration tooling and `DATABASE_URL` resolution.
3. Created `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` with `Task` model (UUID `id`, `title`, `completed`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`).
4. Created `backend/.env.example` with sanitized placeholder configuration.
5. Provisioned local PostgreSQL database `taskmanager` and set `DATABASE_URL` in untracked `backend/.env`.
6. Generated Prisma Client via `npx prisma generate`.
7. Created initial migration `20261002161001_init/migration.sql` via `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`.
8. Implemented `backend/src/prisma/prisma.service.ts` using `PrismaPg` adapter and `pg.Pool` with connection lifecycle management.
9. Implemented `backend/src/prisma/prisma.module.ts` exporting `PrismaService` globally.
10. Updated `backend/src/tasks/tasks.service.ts` with live Prisma queries (`findMany`, `findUnique`, `create`, `update`, `delete`).
11. Updated `backend/src/tasks/tasks.controller.ts` with thin controller delegates.
12. Updated `backend/tsconfig.build.json` to exclude `prisma.config.ts` from NestJS build output rootDir.
13. Compiled backend with `npm run build` (clean exit code 0).
14. Started NestJS server on port 5000 and executed end-to-end CRUD tests against live PostgreSQL:
    - `POST /api/tasks` -> `201 Created` with UUID `id`.
    - `GET /api/tasks` -> `200 OK` returning task array.
    - `PUT /api/tasks/:id` -> `200 OK` toggling `completed: true`.
    - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` -> `200 OK` returning `{"message":"Task deleted"}`.
    - Confirmed task count returned `0` after deletion.
15. Verified that no frontend files were touched and `node_modules` remains untracked.
16. Updated `.agent/context.md`, `.agent/status.md`, `.agent/prompts/decisions.md` (Decision 4), and `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md`.

### Files changed
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` (created)
- `backend/prisma.config.ts` (created)
- `backend/prisma/migrations/20261002161001_init/migration.sql` (created)

- `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md` (updated)

### Verification
- `npx prisma validate`: Output `The schema at prisma\schema.prisma is valid 🚀`.
- `npx prisma migrate dev`: Created and applied `20261002161001_init` to PostgreSQL `taskmanager`.
- `npm run build`: Succeeded with zero errors.
- Live HTTP CRUD Lifecycle:
  - `POST http://localhost:5000/api/tasks` -> Returned `{"id":"fb397544-382d-449a-82fe-8f3379fde15f","title":"First PostgreSQL Task","completed":false,...}` with HTTP 201.
  - `GET http://localhost:5000/api/tasks` -> Returned array containing the persisted task with HTTP 200.
  - `PUT http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/fb397544-...` -> Returned updated task with `completed: true` with HTTP 200.
  - `DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/fb397544-...` -> Returned `{"message":"Task deleted"}` with HTTP 200.
  - `GET http://localhost:5000/api/tasks` -> Returned count `0`.
- Git Status Verification: `git status --short frontend` confirms 0 frontend files touched; `node_modules` untracked.

### Result
Prisma 7 (`7.10.0`) and PostgreSQL persistence fully integrated, verified, and operational. All 4 REST endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) successfully execute real database queries against PostgreSQL.

### Next step
Await user instruction to proceed with validation DTO hardening or start frontend modernization.

## Prompt 6 — Pre-Commit Comprehensive Verification Pass

### User instruction
Before committing this Prisma 7 migration, perform a verification pass:
1. Verify Prisma 7 version: npx prisma --version
2. Verify migration state: npx prisma migrate status
3. Verify the generated Prisma Client exists and is being used by PrismaService.
4. Verify the Task model in schema.prisma matches UUID id, title, completed, createdAt, updatedAt.
5. Verify the database actually contains the Task table.
6. Test the API against PostgreSQL (GET [] -> POST task -> GET task -> PUT task -> DELETE task -> GET []).
7. Run: npm run build.
Use actual verification commands. Do not claim anything passed unless executed. Do NOT modify the frontend. Do NOT commit node_modules, dist, .env, or database credentials. If all verification passes, stop and report the exact commands/results. Do not commit anything yet.

### Agent interpretation
Execute the 7 verification checkpoints using real shell commands and database introspection. Ensure Prisma 7.x pinning, migration sync, Prisma Client generation, schema correctness, physical PostgreSQL table creation, live HTTP CRUD sequence, and TypeScript build all pass completely. Confirm frontend remains untouched and no sensitive files or build outputs are staged for commit. Report exact commands and output logs.

### Action taken
1. Executed `npx prisma --version` verifying Prisma CLI and `@prisma/client` are pinned at `7.10.0`.
2. Executed `npx prisma migrate status` verifying 1 migration in sync with PostgreSQL database `taskmanager`.
3. Verified Prisma Client generation and runtime `Task` delegate availability in `node_modules/@prisma/client`, and verified that `PrismaService` extends `PrismaClient` with `PrismaPg` adapter.
4. Inspected `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` verifying `id` (UUID), `title` (required string), `completed` (boolean default false), `createdAt` (DateTime default now), and `updatedAt` (DateTime).
5. Executed PostgreSQL schema query inspecting table metadata: confirmed `tasks` table exists in `public` schema with expected column types, nullabilities, and defaults.
6. Ran the complete live API test against the NestJS server on port 5000:
   - `GET /api/tasks` -> returned `[]`
   - `POST /api/tasks` -> created task with UUID `549e4b60-5ade-4b0a-99d9-9324e53575ab`
   - `GET /api/tasks` -> returned the persisted task
   - `PUT /api/tasks/:id` -> updated `completed: true` and `title`
   - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` -> deleted record, returned `{"message": "Task deleted"}`
   - `GET /api/tasks` -> returned `[]`
7. Executed `npm run build` with zero errors.
8. Verified `git status --short frontend` confirms 0 files modified; untracked `backend/.env` from git index; verified `node_modules` and `dist/` remain untracked.

### Files changed
- `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md` (updated)

### Verification
- All 7 checkpoints executed and passed cleanly. Zero mock data or skipped tests.

### Result
Verification pass complete. System is completely verified, build passes, database and API behave correctly, and no changes are committed.

### Next step
Await user confirmation to proceed with commit or next development phase.

## Prompt 7 — API Validation Hardening (DTOs, ValidationPipe, ParseUUIDPipe)

### User instruction
Implement the API validation hardening phase. Requirements:
1. Add class-validator and class-transformer.
2. Create DTOs: CreateTaskDto, UpdateTaskDto.
3. CreateTaskDto: title required, non-empty string, trim/transform input appropriately.
4. UpdateTaskDto: title optional, completed optional, validate both when provided.
5. Enable NestJS global ValidationPipe with whitelist: true, forbidNonWhitelisted: true, transform: true.
6. Keep controllers thin; validation belongs at HTTP boundary; business logic in TasksService.
7. Handle invalid task IDs cleanly: invalid UUIDs return HTTP 400.
8. Preserve existing API (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/tasks).
9. Do NOT modify the frontend.
10. Do NOT modify Prisma schema or database structure.
11. Do NOT add authentication, pagination, analytics, or unrelated features.
12. Update .agent/status.md, .agent/prompts/decisions.md, .agent/prompts/prompt-history.md.
13. Verify with actual tests/commands: valid POST succeeds, empty title rejected with 400, unknown fields rejected, valid PUT succeeds, invalid UUID returns 400, npm run build succeeds. Do not commit changes. Report files changed, commands executed, verification results, issues encountered.

### Agent interpretation
Harden the NestJS backend's HTTP request boundary using declarative validation and transformation. Install `class-validator` and `class-transformer`. Define `CreateTaskDto` and `UpdateTaskDto` with whitespace trimming and type constraints. Mount global `ValidationPipe` with strict whitelisting and unknown field rejection (`forbidNonWhitelisted: true`). Apply `ParseUUIDPipe` to path parameters in `TasksController` to catch malformed UUIDs at the controller layer and return HTTP 400. Execute real HTTP requests to verify all validation constraints and build health. Maintain strict isolation of frontend and database schema, and update `.agent/` documentation without committing.

### Action taken
1. Installed `class-validator` (0.15.1) and `class-transformer` (0.5.1) in `backend/package.json`.
2. Created `backend/src/tasks/dto/create-task.dto.ts` with `@Transform` trimming, `@IsString`, and `@IsNotEmpty`.
3. Created `backend/src/tasks/dto/update-task.dto.ts` with optional trimmed `title` and optional boolean `completed`.
4. Updated `backend/src/main.ts` with `app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({ whitelist: true, forbidNonWhitelisted: true, transform: true }))`.
5. Updated `backend/src/tasks/tasks.controller.ts` to bind DTOs and apply `new ParseUUIDPipe()` to `:id` path parameters on `findOne`, `update`, and `remove`.
6. Updated `backend/src/tasks/tasks.service.ts` to accept `CreateTaskDto` and `UpdateTaskDto`.
7. Executed `npm run build` cleanly (exit code 0).
8. Tested live HTTP endpoints:
   - Valid POST (`{"title": "Valid Hardened Task"}`) -> `201 Created` with UUID.
   - Empty title POST (`{"title": ""}`) -> `400 Bad Request` (`["Title must not be empty"]`).
   - Whitespace title POST (`{"title": "   "}`) -> `400 Bad Request` (`["Title must not be empty"]`).
   - Unknown field POST (`{"title": "Valid", "extraField": "malicious"}`) -> `400 Bad Request` (`["property extraField should not exist"]`).
   - Valid PUT (`{"completed": true, "title": "Updated"}`) -> `200 OK`.
   - Invalid field type PUT (`{"completed": "not-bool"}`) -> `400 Bad Request` (`["Completed must be a boolean"]`).
   - Invalid UUID GET/PUT/DELETE (`/api/tasks/not-a-valid-uuid`) -> `400 Bad Request` (`Validation failed (uuid is expected)`).
   - Valid UUID not found (`/api/tasks/<valid-uuid-not-in-db>`) -> `404 Not Found`.
9. Updated `.agent/status.md`, `.agent/prompts/decisions.md` (Decision 5), and `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md`.
10. Preserved frontend with zero modifications; no database schema changes; no git commits.

## Prompt 8 — Phase 4: Frontend TypeScript Migration & Dynamic API Integration

### User instruction
Implement Phase 4: Frontend TypeScript migration.
Requirements:
1. Convert existing frontend JavaScript/JSX files to TypeScript/TSX where appropriate.
2. Introduce shared Task interface: id, title, completed, createdAt, updatedAt.
3. Update Axios API client: use import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL, remove hardcoded Render backend URL, keep paths under /api/tasks.
4. Add frontend .env.example: VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000.
5. Keep existing UI and functionality intact (do NOT redesign yet).
6. Update all components to use new `id` field instead of MongoDB `_id`.
7. Add proper TypeScript types for API responses, component props, task state, form state, API errors.
8. Do NOT introduce external state-management libraries (Redux, Zustand, React Query); keep local React state.
9. Do NOT modify backend code.
10. Do NOT modify Prisma schema or migrations.
11. Do NOT add authentication or unrelated features.
12. Update .agent/status.md, .agent/prompts/decisions.md, .agent/prompts/prompt-history.md.
13. Verify: npm install, npm run build, confirm TypeScript compilation succeeds, confirm no _id references remain, confirm no hardcoded backend URL remains, confirm frontend API configuration uses VITE_API_URL. Do not commit changes. Report files changed, architectural decisions, commands executed, verification results, issues encountered. Stop after Phase 4.

### Agent interpretation
Migrate the `frontend/` subproject from untyped JavaScript to TypeScript without altering existing visual styling, layout, or component architecture. Introduce `frontend/tsconfig.json` with strict type checking. Create shared types (`Task`, `CreateTaskInput`, `UpdateTaskInput`, `ApiResponse`, `ApiErrorResponse`). Migrate all `.jsx`/`.js` components and configuration to `.tsx`/`.ts` (`main.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `AddTask.tsx`, `TaskList.tsx`, `api.ts`, `vite.config.ts`, `vite-env.d.ts`). Eradicate all `task._id` references in favor of UUID `task.id`. Replace hardcoded Render URLs with `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`. Ensure `npm run build` (`tsc && vite build`) passes with zero errors. Preserve backend isolation and leave working tree uncommitted.

### Action taken
1. Installed `typescript` in `frontend/package.json`.
2. Created `frontend/tsconfig.json` with strict ES2022 / React-JSX compiler settings.
3. Created `frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts` for Vite environment variable typing.
4. Created `frontend/src/types/task.ts` with `Task` interface (`id`, `title`, `completed`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`), inputs, and response interfaces.
5. Replaced `frontend/src/api.js` with `frontend/src/api.ts` using `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` and typed Axios calls targeting `/api/tasks`.
6. Created `frontend/src/components/AddTask.tsx` and removed `AddTask.jsx`.
7. Created `frontend/src/components/TaskList.tsx` replacing `task._id` with `task.id` and removed `TaskList.jsx`.
8. Created `frontend/src/App.tsx` replacing all `t._id` references with `t.id` and removed `App.jsx`.
9. Created `frontend/src/main.tsx` and removed `main.jsx`.
10. Created `frontend/vite.config.ts` and removed `vite.config.js`.
11. Updated `frontend/index.html` to point to `/src/main.tsx`.
12. Updated `frontend/package.json` build script to `"tsc && vite build"`.
13. Created `frontend/.env.example` with `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`.
14. Added `.env` and `.env.*` to `frontend/.gitignore`.
15. Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` in `frontend/`, verifying clean compilation with 0 errors.
16. Scanned for `_id` and hardcoded URLs across frontend (confirmed 0 occurrences).
17. Updated `.agent/status.md`, `.agent/prompts/decisions.md` (Decision 6), and `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md`.

- No git commits executed.

### Result
Frontend TypeScript migration complete. All components strongly typed and operating with standard UUID `task.id` and dynamic environment API configuration.

### Next step
Await user instructions for Phase 5 (TaskFlow Kanban UI evolution, 3-column workflow board, and Task Insights analytics).

## Prompt 9 — Phase 5A: Task Domain & API Extension (Status, Priority, DueDate)

### User instruction
Implement Phase 5A: Task domain/API extension. Follow .agent docs. Goal: Extend Task domain to support upcoming Kanban workflow without changing frontend UI yet. Add fields: status (enum: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE; default: TODO), priority (enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH; default: MEDIUM), dueDate (optional DateTime). Requirements:
1. Update Prisma schema and create new Prisma migration.
2. Use Prisma 7.x only.
3. Update DTOs with validation.
4. Update TasksService and API responses.
5. Preserve existing CRUD endpoints.
6. Keep controllers thin.
7. Do not implement Kanban UI.
8. Do not implement drag-and-drop.
9. Do not add analytics yet.
10. Do not modify unrelated frontend files.
Validation: status accepts TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE; priority accepts LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH; dueDate must be valid date when provided; existing tasks remain valid.
Verification: run migration, prisma migrate status, npm run build, test GET/POST/PUT/DELETE against PostgreSQL, test invalid status, test invalid priority, test invalid dueDate, verify existing CRUD works. Update .agent/status.md, decisions.md, prompt-history.md. Do not commit anything. Stop after Phase 5A.

### Agent interpretation
Evolve the relational data model and NestJS backend to support Kanban workflows by adding PostgreSQL-native enums `TaskStatus` and `TaskPriority` alongside an optional `dueDate` timestamp. Run the Prisma migration with defaults to ensure existing records remain fully valid. Extend `CreateTaskDto` and `UpdateTaskDto` with enum and ISO-date validators. Enhance `TasksService` with two-way synchronization between `completed` and `status` so legacy client toggles (`completed: true`) automatically map to `DONE`. Keep the controller thin and REST routes unchanged. Update frontend shared domain types in `types/task.ts` without touching UI components. Verify live HTTP endpoints and build compilation.

### Action taken
1. Updated `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` with `TaskStatus` enum (`TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`), `TaskPriority` enum (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`), and added `status`, `priority`, and nullable `dueDate` to `Task` model.
2. Validated schema via `npx prisma validate`.
3. Created and executed migration `20261002195351_add_task_status_priority_due_date` via `npx prisma migrate dev`.
4. Regenerated Prisma Client (`npx prisma generate`).
5. Verified database sync via `npx prisma migrate status`.
6. Updated `CreateTaskDto` and `UpdateTaskDto` with `@IsEnum` and `@IsISO8601` validators.
7. Updated `TasksService` (`create`, `update`, `findAll`) to handle new fields and synchronize `completed` and `status`.
8. Updated `frontend/src/types/task.ts` to include `status`, `priority`, and `dueDate` in `Task`, `CreateTaskInput`, and `UpdateTaskInput`.
9. Executed `npm run build` in both `backend` and `frontend`.
10. Verified live HTTP endpoints against PostgreSQL:
    - Default `POST /api/tasks` assigns `status: TODO`, `priority: MEDIUM`, `dueDate: null`, `completed: false`.
    - Explicit `POST` creates task with custom status, priority, and due date.
    - Invalid status returns 400 Bad Request (`Status must be one of: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE`).
    - Invalid priority returns 400 Bad Request (`Priority must be one of: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH`).
    - Invalid dueDate returns 400 Bad Request (`DueDate must be a valid ISO 8601 date string`).
    - `PUT /api/tasks/:id` updates status/priority/dueDate and synchronizes `completed` flag.
    - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` deletes task.
11. Updated `.agent/status.md`, `.agent/prompts/decisions.md` (Decision 7), and `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md`.

### Files changed
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` (modified)
- `backend/prisma/migrations/20261002195351_add_task_status_priority_due_date/migration.sql` (created)

### Verification
- `npx prisma migrate status`: Database schema up to date (2 migrations).
- `npm run build` (backend): Succeeded with zero errors.
- `npm run build` (frontend): Succeeded with zero errors.
- Live HTTP validation:
  - Default creation: 201 Created with schema defaults.
  - Invalid status: Rejected (400 Bad Request).
  - Invalid priority: Rejected (400 Bad Request).
  - Invalid dueDate: Rejected (400 Bad Request).
  - Two-way status/completed toggle: Verified 200 OK.
  - Existing CRUD routes: 100% operational.
- Frontend isolation: Zero UI components modified.
- No git commits executed.

### Result
Phase 5A completed and verified. Task domain and backend API fully support Kanban workflows with relational integrity and backward compatibility.

### Next step
Await user instructions for Phase 5B (TaskFlow Kanban UI evolution: 3-column workflow board, drag-and-drop, priority badges, filters, and Task Insights).

## Prompt 10 — Phase 5B: Basic TaskFlow Kanban UI (3-Column Layout, Status Transitions & Inline Card Actions)

### User instruction
Implement Phase 5B: Basic TaskFlow Kanban UI.
Follow .agent docs.
Goal: Replace current task list presentation with a clean 3-column Kanban board (TODO → "To Do", IN_PROGRESS → "In Progress", DONE → "Done").
Requirements:
1. Use existing React + TypeScript frontend.
2. Use existing REST API.
3. Display tasks in the correct column based on status.
4. Task cards must display: title, priority, due date when present.
5. Preserve existing: create task, edit/update task, delete task.
6. New tasks should use backend defaults.
7. Allow changing task status through existing edit/update mechanism.
8. Add basic responsive styling using existing Tailwind setup.
9. Keep UI light and clean.
10. Do NOT implement drag-and-drop yet.
11. Do NOT implement analytics yet.
12. Do NOT add Redux, Zustand, React Query, or another state library.
13. Do NOT modify backend code.
14. Do NOT modify Prisma schema or migrations.
15. Do not introduce unrelated dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
Architecture: keep components small/reusable, API calls in API client, keep logic out of presentational components, use existing Task types, do not reintroduce _id.
Verification: npm run build, verify all 3 columns render, verify tasks appear under correct status, verify create/update/delete works, verify priority and dueDate display, verify responsive layout, verify no backend/database files changed.
Update .agent/status.md, decisions.md, prompt-history.md. Record only executed commands. Do NOT commit. Stop after Phase 5B and provide concise report.

### Agent interpretation
Construct a modular, responsive 3-column Kanban board replacing the single-column `TaskList`. Group tasks strictly by status (`TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`). Build presentational components `KanbanBoard`, `KanbanColumn`, and `TaskCard` cleanly styled with Tailwind CSS without adding external state management libraries or drag-and-drop dependencies. In `TaskCard`, display title, styled priority badges (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`), formatted due dates, direct status selector dropdown, inline edit form, and delete button. Update `AddTask` to preserve backend defaults while offering expandable fields for status, priority, and due date. Remove obsolete `TaskList.tsx`. Update root `App.tsx` with header summary metric counters and board orchestration. Verify TypeScript compilation, ESLint, responsive layout, live REST API integration, and confirm zero changes to backend or database.

### Action taken
1. Updated `frontend/src/types/task.ts` with `TaskStatus` (`TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`) and `TaskPriority` (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`), and extended `CreateTaskInput` and `UpdateTaskInput`.
2. Created `frontend/src/components/TaskCard.tsx` with priority badges, formatted due dates (`📅`), status dropdown selector, inline editing modal, and delete button.
3. Created `frontend/src/components/KanbanColumn.tsx` displaying semantic column headers, live task count pill badges, and empty-state messaging.
4. Created `frontend/src/components/KanbanBoard.tsx` partitioning tasks into `TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, and `DONE` columns across a responsive Tailwind CSS grid (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-5`).
5. Updated `frontend/src/components/AddTask.tsx` with clean title submission using backend defaults and an expandable drawer for optional priority, status, and due date inputs.
6. Updated `frontend/src/App.tsx` with header summary metrics (Total, To Do, In Progress, Done counts), error banner with retry, and Kanban board integration.
7. Removed obsolete `frontend/src/components/TaskList.tsx`.
8. Executed `npm run build` in `frontend/` (`tsc && vite build`) and `backend/` (`nest build`).
9. Executed `npm run lint` in `frontend/` (`eslint .`).
10. Executed live HTTP tests against the backend confirming:
    - Default task creation via `POST /api/tasks` assigns `status: "TODO"`, `priority: "MEDIUM"`, `dueDate: null`.
    - Status transitions and updates via `PUT /api/tasks/:id` update status, priority, and due dates.
    - Task deletion via `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` removes tasks cleanly.
    - Status segregation accurately places tasks into their respective Kanban columns.
11. Confirmed zero backend or Prisma files were touched via `git status --short`.
12. Updated `.agent/status.md`, `.agent/prompts/decisions.md` (Decision 8), and `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md`.

- `Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/:id" -Method Delete`: Verified task deletion.

### Result
Phase 5B successfully implemented and verified. The single task list is replaced by a clean, responsive 3-column Kanban board with live status transitions, priority badges, due dates, and full CRUD support.

### Next step
Await user instruction for Phase 5C (Native HTML5 Drag-and-Drop) or Phase 6 (Task Insights Analytics Dashboard).

## Prompt 11 — Phase 5C: Native HTML5 Drag-and-Drop (Column Transitions & Failure Rollback)

### User instruction
Implement Phase 5C: Native HTML5 Drag-and-Drop.
Follow .agent docs.
Goal: Allow users to drag a task card between the three Kanban columns and persist the new status through the existing REST API.
Requirements:
1. Use native HTML5 Drag and Drop APIs only.
2. Do NOT install a drag-and-drop library.
3. Do NOT modify the backend.
4. Do NOT modify Prisma schema or migrations.
Behavior:
- TaskCard must be draggable.
- KanbanColumn must act as drop target.
- Dropping changes status: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE.
- Persist using PUT /api/tasks/:id { "status": "<new status>" }.
- Moving to DONE -> completed=true.
- Moving out of DONE -> completed=false.
UI:
- Clearly indicate when column is valid drop target.
- Provide subtle visual indication while dragging.
- Do not redesign existing board.
- Maintain mobile responsiveness.
- Prevent accidental deletion/editing while dragging.
State handling:
- Optimistically update UI cleanly.
- If API fails, restore previous task state and show user-visible error.
- Do not silently swallow API failures.
- Prevent duplicate status requests when dropped into current column.
Architecture: keep DnD separated from API client, reuse Task/TaskStatus types, keep API calls in client, no global state.
Verification: npm run build, npm run lint, test dragging (TODO -> IN_PROGRESS -> DONE -> TODO), verify persistence, verify completed sync, test API failure rollback/error handling, verify no backend/database files changed, verify no new dependency.
Update .agent docs, record only executed commands, do NOT commit. Stop and provide concise report.

### Agent interpretation
Implement native HTML5 Drag and Drop across `TaskCard` and `KanbanColumn` with zero external dependencies. Make `TaskCard` draggable when not in editing mode, providing reduced opacity and grab styling during drag. In `KanbanColumn`, implement drag enter, over, leave, and drop handlers with a `dragCounter` ref to prevent hover flickering over child elements, and render a highlighted drop zone cue. In `App.tsx`, build `handleDropTask` with optimistic UI updates, immediate status and `completed` synchronization, duplicate drop suppression, and automated state rollback with an error alert banner upon API failure. Verify builds, linters, end-to-end status transitions, failure rollbacks, and backend isolation.

### Action taken
1. Updated `frontend/src/components/TaskCard.tsx`:
   - Added `draggable={!isEditing}` attribute.
   - Added `onDragStart` and `onDragEnd` event handlers storing `task.id` in `dataTransfer`.
   - Applied subtle dragging visual state (`opacity-40 scale-[0.98] border-dashed border-blue-400`).
   - Attached `draggable={false}` and `preventDefault()` on Edit/Delete buttons and status selector to prevent accidental dragging during interactions.
2. Updated `frontend/src/components/KanbanColumn.tsx`:
   - Attached `onDragEnter`, `onDragLeave`, `onDragOver`, and `onDrop`.
   - Added `dragCounter` ref to eliminate child hover flickering.
   - Added dynamic drop target styling (`ring-2 ring-blue-400 bg-blue-50/70 border-blue-400`) and a drop cue indicator.
   - Forwarded dropped `taskId` and target column `status` to `onDropTask`.
3. Updated `frontend/src/components/KanbanBoard.tsx`:
   - Propagated `onDropTask` prop down to each `KanbanColumn`.
4. Updated `frontend/src/App.tsx`:
   - Implemented `handleDropTask`:
     - Suppresses duplicate status updates if dropped in the current column.
     - Creates immutable previous state snapshot.
     - Optimistically updates task list and status (`completed: targetStatus === 'DONE'`).
     - Calls `updateTask(taskId, { status: targetStatus })`.
     - Reconciles with server response on success.
     - Reverts to snapshot and displays user-visible error banner on network/server failure.
   - Connected `onDropTask={handleDropTask}` on `KanbanBoard`.
   - Added dismiss button on error alert banner.
5. Executed `npm run build` in `frontend/` (`tsc && vite build`) and `backend/` (`nest build`).
6. Executed `npm run lint` in `frontend/` (`eslint .`).
7. Executed live HTTP tests against backend verifying status transitions (`TODO` -> `IN_PROGRESS` -> `DONE` -> `TODO`) and two-way `completed` synchronization.
8. Executed automated unit tests (`node test_dnd_logic.mjs`) confirming duplicate drop suppression, optimistic state update, completed flag toggling, and failure rollback.
9. Confirmed zero backend files, zero Prisma files, and zero new dependencies were introduced.
10. Updated `.agent/status.md`, `.agent/prompts/decisions.md` (Decision 9), and `.agent/prompts/prompt-history.md`.

- `Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/:id" -Method Put` (DONE -> TODO): Status=TODO, Completed=False.
- `node test_dnd_logic.mjs`: All 5 automated state machine tests passed (duplicate suppression, optimistic updates, completed synchronization, failure rollback).
- `git status --short`: Verified only `frontend/` components and `.agent/` documentation modified; 0 backend or database files touched.

### Result
Phase 5C successfully implemented and verified. Native HTML5 drag-and-drop seamlessly moves task cards between To Do, In Progress, and Done columns with optimistic updates, failure rollback, and zero external libraries.

### Next step
Await user instruction for Phase 6: TaskFlow Task Insights / Analytics Dashboard.
